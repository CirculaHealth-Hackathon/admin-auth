## Core Features:

- Responsive Layout: Implement a two-column split layout for desktop, transitioning to a stacked layout on mobile for responsiveness. Image on top and form at the bottom for mobile.
- User-Friendly Form: Design a visually appealing form with clearly labeled fields (email and password), a primary action button, and social sign-in options (Apple, Google, X).
- Input Validations: Ensure error states on the form guide the user to a successful form submission.
- Feedback Mechanism: Enable users to quickly understand error and success states during login and registration, making the overall process very clear.

- Use Tailwind's default sans-serif font for a modern and clean look.

- Maintain a clean and consistent spacing between form elements (e.g., space-y-4) for visual clarity.
